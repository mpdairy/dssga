# dssga

A (soon-to-be Distributed) Steady State Genetic Algorithm.  There are three functions:

(make-population num-indivs genes-per-indiv)  --> new random population

(get-individual pop)  --> new untested individual

(put-individual indiv pop)  --> latest population



Individuals are maps {:fitness 0 :chromosome [0.3224 -0.9324 0.43214 0.001 -0.43224 ...]}

Genes are random between -1.0 and 1.0.

Populations are lists of individuals.

get-individual breeds a new individual from two adults using roulette wheel selection, or any untested individuals (with fitness 0)

put-individual takes an individual with fitness > 0 and returns a population with the new indiv added and one other dropped out.  The killed individual is based on inverted roulette wheel selection, where lower fitness has higher chance of being selected.


## Usage

;max-ones evolve a chromosome with max positive genes

(defn max-ones [pop individuals_tested]
	(loop [pop pop individuals_tested individuals_tested]
	(if (= 0 individuals_tested)
		(reduce (fn [a b] (if (> (:fitness a) (:fitness b)) a b)) {:fitness 0} pop)
		(letfn [(calc-fitness [indiv]
							(max 0.1 (* 1.0 (reduce (fn [a b] (+ a b)) 0 (:chromosome indiv)))))]
			(let [indiv (get-individual pop)
						fitness (calc-fitness indiv)]
						(recur (put-individual (assoc indiv :fitness fitness) pop) (dec individuals_tested)))))))

(max-ones (make-populations 100 10000))
